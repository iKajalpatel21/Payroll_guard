PayrollGuard is a real-time, AI-powered fraud detection system designed to protect payroll and HR platforms from post-login attacks. Unlike traditional security controls that focus only on authentication, PayrollGuard operates at the action layer, monitoring employee behavior after login to detect and stop fraudulent payroll changes before money is moved.
Payroll fraud is one of the most damaging and least-detected forms of financial crime. Attackers often bypass defenses by using stolen credentials or abusing insider access, allowing them to silently change direct deposit details. Existing systems rarely flag these actions because logins appear legitimate. PayrollGuard was built specifically to close this gap.
At its core, PayrollGuard continuously evaluates behavioral signals such as device familiarity, IP reputation, login timing, navigation patterns, typing speed, clipboard usage, and bank account deviations. Each action is scored in real time using a weighted risk engine. High-risk patterns are further analyzed by an AI decision layer, which determines whether the activity is likely fraud, genuine behavior, or uncertain.
Based on this analysis, PayrollGuard automatically:
approves low-risk actions with no user friction,
challenges medium-risk actions using step-up verification,
and blocks high-risk actions instantly, securing the account and preventing payroll theft.
The system is designed for enterprise scale, capable of handling coordinated attack surges without interrupting legitimate employees. All decisions are recorded in a tamper-evident cryptographic audit trail, ensuring full transparency, compliance readiness, and forensic traceability.
PayrollGuard integrates seamlessly into existing payroll portals and operates silently in the background, protecting employees’ paychecks while preserving a smooth user experience.
In short: PayrollGuard doesn’t make payroll harder. It makes paycheck theft impossible.
